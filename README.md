## 3. Data Analyst Techniques 

- **3.1. Data Aggregation (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`)**
  
  ‚ñ™ Used aggregate functions to compute key metrics such as **total revenue**, **total pizzas sold**, and **total orders**.  
  ‚ñ™ Applied `GROUP BY` to segment results by **pizza category**, **pizza size**, and **time period** for more granular insights.  
  ‚ñ™ Example: Summing `total_price` grouped by `pizza_category` to identify top-performing product categories.  

- **3.2. KPI Calculation (Revenue, AOV, Orders, Quantity)**
  
  ‚ñ™ Designed and calculated **core performance metrics** including:  
    - **Total Revenue** (`SUM(total_price)`)  
    - **Average Order Value (AOV)** (Revenue √∑ Unique Orders)  
    - **Total Orders** (`COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`)  
    - **Total Pizzas Sold** (`SUM(quantity)`)  
    - **Average Pizzas per Order** (Pizzas Sold √∑ Orders)  
  ‚ñ™ Ensured precision by applying `CAST()` for decimal formatting in business reporting.  

- **3.3. Window Functions (`RANK() OVER`)**
  
  ‚ñ™ Used `RANK()` to assign ranking to pizzas based on **sales volume** in both **descending** (top sellers) and **ascending** (bottom sellers) order.  
  ‚ñ™ Enabled filtering for **top 5** and **bottom 5** performers through subqueries, streamlining menu engineering decisions.  

- **3.4. Date & Time Handling (`EXTRACT`, `MONTH`)**
  
  ‚ñ™ Extracted **day** and **hour** from order timestamps to detect **daily and hourly demand peaks**.  
  ‚ñ™ Filtered by `MONTH(order_date)` to perform **seasonal or monthly category sales analysis**.  
  ‚ñ™ Facilitated time-based staffing and promotional planning.  

- **3.5. Percentage Contribution Calculations**
  
  ‚ñ™ Computed each category‚Äôs and size‚Äôs contribution to total revenue using:  
    - `SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price)...)`  
  ‚ñ™ Allowed management to identify **high-impact products** for targeted marketing and resource allocation.  

- **3.6. Filtering & Ranking with Subqueries**
  
  ‚ñ™ Implemented **nested SELECT statements** to apply filters **after aggregation** (e.g., filter top 5 best sellers after ranking).  
  ‚ñ™ Ensured efficient query structure to avoid recomputing aggregates multiple times.  

- **3.7. Business-Oriented Query Structuring for Decision-Making**
  
  ‚ñ™ Wrote queries with **clear business objectives** in mind, focusing on actionable outcomes such as:  
    - Peak sales hours ‚Üí staffing adjustments  
    - Category/size preferences ‚Üí menu optimization  
    - Top/bottom sellers ‚Üí promotional focus or removal  

- **3.8. Excel Dashboarding (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts)**
  
  ‚ñ™ Imported SQL query outputs into Excel for visualization.  
  ‚ñ™ Created **pivot tables** to summarize key metrics dynamically.  
  ‚ñ™ Added **slicers** for interactive filtering by date, category, and size.  
  ‚ñ™ Designed **charts** (bar, line, pie) to visualize trends, category performance, and size preferences for stakeholders.
